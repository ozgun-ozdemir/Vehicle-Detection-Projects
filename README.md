# Vehicle Detection Projects

This repository contains multiple vehicle detection and tracking projects built using YOLO and OpenCV.

## Projects

1. vehicle_detect - Basic vehicle detection in video frames.
2. vehicle_detect_id - Vehicle detection with unique ID tracking for each vehicle.
3. vehicle_detect_roi - Vehicle detection within a specific region of interest (ROI).
4. vehicle_detect_direction - Vehicle detection with direction tracking (incoming and outgoing vehicles).

## Requirements

- `Python 3.x`
- `OpenCV`
- `YOLO11`
